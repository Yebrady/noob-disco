\f0\fs24 \cf0 So, this program was a little bit more challenging than I expected. I began by just creating the outline of the program (classes, methods, etc.). I thought the types were fairly self explanatory, I knew that I could return Integer values, but ended up using Strings just so I could concatenate in the Tester file. I also started with saving all of the numerators and denominators at the beginning of the methods, but found it a little redundant, and ended up just using this.num and fraction.num instead to shorten down the amount of code. My tests I decided to just print out the answer of everything, making sure it worked using simple fractions. The latter ones test the quotient as a float and a double as well as displaying the remainder. I had difficulty with the gcd function, I had the simplify part working, but for a long time couldn\'92t implement the gcd to have it work. I ended up trying a couple different ways of getting the gcd, and eventually found one that worked.}
