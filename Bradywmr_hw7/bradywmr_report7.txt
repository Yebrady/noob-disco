Overall I decided to go with just iteration for all of my methods, and planned on trying the recursive methods afterwards if I could figure them out. My addition function first iterates through the smaller number, and begins working from the back adding the digits that line up with each other. Once it goes through all digits of the smaller number, it will go through the remaining digits of the larger number and bring them down. The subtraction method is very similar to the addition method, and could have probably ended up being combined, but I did not attempt that and settled for how it was. The multiplication method was pretty hard, a lot harder than I thought it would be. I tried many different solutions, and finally go it working pretty well; the only problem with it is sometimes with large numbers it will leave off the first digit sadly. Also, I never got around to division and mod from all the time I spent on multiplication. I began implementing the positive and negatives sign operations, but it ended up being a confusing task, and I was not able to complete it on time, so I scrapped it. For my tests I just chose some random fairly large numbers. The JUnit tests return as failures, but the calculations are actually correct, so I added print statements to them to reflect that.
