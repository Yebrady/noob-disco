\f0\fs24 \cf0 The class interfaces meet the quality criteria discussed because they directly follow the basic pattern outlined in the powerpoint slides. First the class defines the instance variable front and back. The FlashCards class has four methods, a set and get method for both the front and back. The set methods serves as both the add and clear method. The get methods satisfy the query method outlined in the notes. Now, in the box class the instance variable is defined to be an array list. This class has three methods, an add, remove, and get method for the flash cards in the box, which are the three basic methods to fulfill the basic class pattern. My approach to testing was using JUnit testing of every all add/remove functions to make sure they were properly working. I used the get methods to compare the object/arraylist to hard coded answers of what should be contained in the object/arraylist. I did not really have many difficulties in this assignment; after the lab and lectures it was fairly clear what was expected of me and the code.}
