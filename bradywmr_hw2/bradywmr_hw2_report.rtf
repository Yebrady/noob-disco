\f0\fs24 \cf0 So the design decisions in this homework were a little bit harder than the last homework assignment. At first I just created my viewer class using JFrame. I tried a bunch of different ideas for actually creating the individual tetrominos; I tried an enum of rectangles, just multiple rectangle objects, but none of those seemed right. After the lab this week, I decided to settle on the polygon object. I used the methods setTetromino and paintComponent as outlined in the instructions. setTetromino sets the empty tetromino object into the randomized tetromino shape. paintComponent colors the shape and paints it to the JFrame window. The test is the window that opens and exits on hitting the exit button. The difficulties I had was the random rotation of the piece, I have a couple of more ideas that I haven\'92t been able to implement yet, but everything I have tried so far has no worked. I\'92d say other than actually defining the shape that would have been my only difficulty on this one.}
